## Introduction

This repository is intended as a guide for various different temperaments that have been developed throughout history to tune keyboard instruments such as the organ, harpsichord, and piano. The fundamental problem that every temperament seeks to solve is how to tune the 12 fixed notes within an octave. Unlike the voice or string instruments, these notes are fixed and cannot practically be adjusted during a performance.

The main output of main.cpp is a table which lists the frequencies of 12 adjacent notes which can begin anywhere, although the most common (and default) option is the octave beginning on middle C. From these frequencies, the widths of the intervals (in units of musical cents) compared to their just counterparts (see below) and the associated beats-per-second are also listed, the latter of which is useful for practical tuning.

## A Brief History

Our ears are most accustomed to **just intonation,** which relates two tones by frequency ratios of small whole numbers. For example, if a tone is played at 256 Hz with another tone at 512 Hz, the frequency ratio is 2:1 and we perceive this interval as a perfect octave. Other consonant intervals have corresponding frequency ratios, including the perfect fifth (3:2), perfect fourth (4:3), major third (5:4), and minor third (6:5). On the other hand, two tones with a ratio of 211:128 are perceived to not be in tune because of the relatively large numbers in the ratio. The smaller the numbers in the ratio, the more consonant we perceive the interval to be and the easier it is to tune two notes to that interval.

The most basic tuning system is **Pythagorean tuning,** which involves only the perfect fifth and the intervals created by stacking perfect fifths. The perfect fifth consists of 7 semitones, while the octave consists of 12. Because 7 and 12 are coprime, the perfect fifth alone can be used to tune every note within the octave. However, it is a well-known problem that 12 stacked fifths fail to close on itself; the resulting interval "should" be exactly 7 perfect octaves, as can easily be demonstrated on a keyboard, but in fact is slightly too wide. The anomalous interval is known as the **Pythagorean comma** ((3/2)<sup>12</sup>:2<sup>7</sup>, or 531441:524288). The presence of this comma means that in Pythagorean tuning, one of the fifths is actually too narrow; it is aptly labeled as a "wolf" fifth. Worse, the tertian harmony ubiquitous in Western music is very dissonant in this tuning system, because the (Pythagorean) major thirds are too wide, while the minor thirds are too narrow.

Central to the music of the Renaissance period was the development of tertian harmony. For the natural evolution of music to proceed in this direction, the major third had to be made just. With this in mind, we introduce the **syntonic comma** (81:80) as the small interval needed to narrow the Pythagorean major third (81:64) to the just major third (5:4). Within the confines of the keyboard, the way to obtain the maximum number of just major thirds is to *temper* all the perfect fifths by a quarter of a syntonic comma. This tuning system is known as **quarter-comma meantone temperament.** The advantage of quarter-comma meantone is the eight pure major thirds available, but the drawbacks are many: a very wide "wolf" fifth, four unusable major thirds, and a rather fluctuating chromatic scale that takes a bit of getting used to. Although modifications to quarter-comma meantone were made in the 16th and 17th centuries, the problems could not completely be eliminated.

In response to new developments in classical music, various forms of **well temperament** were proposed in the 18th and 19th centuries. Common to all well temperaments is the objective of closing the circle of fifths by *unequally* distributing the Pythagorean comma among the perfect fifths. To wit, the wolf fifth is eliminated, and the notion of "key color" emerges with the varying widths of the major and minor thirds among the different keys. Some of the most famous well temperaments are known by names such as Wreckmeister III, Kirnberger III, and Young I, all of which were proposed in the 18th century. In more recent times, a plethora of new well temperaments have been made by scholars and enthusiasts.

The most commonly used temperament today is **equal temperament,** where every perfect fifth is tempered by 1/12th of a Pythagorean comma. Every interval sounds the same, and one can freely modulate to any key without worry. Equal temperament is also equivalent to that tuning system where every semitone has a ratio of 2<sup>1/12</sup>:1. Because the 12th root of 2 is irrational, no interval besides the octave is perfectly in tune. However, in practice, the perfect fifths and fourths are very close to pure, and owing to the overtone-poor acoustics of the piano, listeners have learned to tolerate the wide major thirds and narrow minor thirds found in this temperament.
